# Development

## Usage Instructions
To utilize the application, the user would need to utilize Node.js, JSON, npm, and potientially more (depends on what already exists on the device).
<br>
Once the device has this application in place, testing may begin with "node app". That line in the Terminal will bring up questions for the user to answer about employees. Once the questions are completely filled out (if successfully), a UI is created in an output folder.
